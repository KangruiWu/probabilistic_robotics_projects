To run this code, you need to have Python and several libraries installed on your computer, including OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (sklearn), Pandas, and Seaborn. It is recommended to use Jupyter Notebook to run this code as it allows for easy visualization of the output.

To set up and run this code, follow the steps below:
1.	Install Python and the required libraries mentioned above. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager.
2.	Download the 'BayMap.png' image and save it in the same directory as the Python script.
3.	Open Jupyter Notebook on your computer and open the HW2_PF.IPYNB file.

Note: You may need to adjust the values of the parameters, such as NUM_PARTICLES, SIGMA_MOVE, SIGMA_OBS, MAP_SCALE, and OBS_SIZE, to obtain better results depending on the map and the specific use case.
